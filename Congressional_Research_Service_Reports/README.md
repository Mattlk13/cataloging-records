# Congressional Research Service Reports

In September 2018, the Library of Congress began releasing Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports to the public at [crsreports.congress.gov](https://crsreports.congress.gov/). Under [an agreement with the Library](https://www.fdlp.gov/news-and-events/3772-congressional-research-service-reports-now-available-online), the GPO catalogs individual reports in the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/). PURLS in the GPO records link directly to the CRS site. As these reports are updated frequently, the GPO has cataloged each report as an integrating resource.

As of July 31, 2021, the GPO has cataloged 7,466 CRS reports. The records are available in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML. The GPO will periodically post new files with records cataloged since August 1, 2021.

Local MARC 922 fields with the term, CRSREP, enable retrieving these records via the [expert search mode](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dcrsrep&x=0&y=0) in the CGP.

Please send us your feedback and questions about our repository and records via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/) > Federal Depository Library Program > Cataloging/Metadata (Policy and Records) category.
